# STATUS

- We have sketched out a number of graphs that we want implemented in the frontend
- These graphs were designed by 'domain experts' and have zero UX input (leading to the next point)
- We have created a static html pages at `cbs/Documentation/Projects/Analytics/Web Mockup` where we are generating the graphs using Highcharts. A couple are still missing. We chose to create this as the React frontend was not yet running and we didn't want this to slow down our progress.
- We have moved 3 of the graphs in the Web Mockup to the React frontend.
- We have created a way of populating MongoDB with test data, see [documentation here](https://github.com/IFRCGo/cbs/tree/master/Source/Analytics#populating-the-database-with-test-data)
- The back-end query towards MongoDB have been written for one graph (AgeAndSexDistributionAggregationByDateRange).

## What needs to be done

- We strongly suspect that these graphs should be presented in some sort of dashboard, but due to the lack of UX input/experience we have not considered how they should be displayed in a holistic manner. We have asked the UX team to provide us with this, and they will update [UXPin](https://preview.uxpin.com/6f7c2440d8ba5f7888d63932bbc82c4138712847#/pages/101608059/simulate/sitemap) with a design. 
- Add the missing charts to the Web Mockup
- Code the frontend (move the charts from the Web Mockup to the React frontend)
- Code all the backend queries to provide data to the frontend (see `Source\Analytics\Read\AgeAndSexDistribution\AgeAndSexDistributionAggregationByDateRange.cs` for reference)
- Link the backend and the frontend (currently, the charts in the React frontend are generated from static data in the javascript)
- Generate the graph based on user input (currently all the graphs are simply displayed on the page, the user cannot specify timerange, age, sex etc. to display on the graphs). A lot of the epicurves are actually just variants on a single graph, so in the future it would probably be smart to just make this 1 extremely dynamic graph. We are calling this the **dynamic epicurve** (https://github.com/IFRCGo/cbs/issues/922).
- Figure out where to extract geographical values (district, region, village) from the GPS coordinates. Currently, all the generated graphs show all the data (national level).
- Figure out where to get the population number (today, this does not exist in CBS). The graphs do not account for this today.
- Get 'domain experts' to provide appropriate labels for everything (e.g. 'number of reported alerts' instead of 'number of cases')

# DEFINITIONS

**Epicurve**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toplotNational <- d[,.(n=sum(value)),keyby=.(epiWeek,age,sex)]
toplotNational[,level:="all"]
toplotNational[,geo:="all"]
toplotRegion <- d[,.(n=sum(value)),keyby=.(region,epiWeek,age,sex)]
toplotRegion[,level:="region"]
setnames(toplotRegion,"region","geo")
toplotDistrict <- d[,.(n=sum(value)),keyby=.(district,epiWeek,age,sex)]
toplotDistrict[,level:="district"]
setnames(toplotDistrict,"district","geo")
toplotVillage <- d[,.(n=sum(value)),keyby=.(village,epiWeek,age,sex)]
toplotVillage[,level:="village"]
setnames(toplotVillage,"village","geo")
tosave1 <- rbind(toplotNational,toplotRegion,toplotDistrict,toplotVillage)
tosave2 <- tosave1[,.(n=sum(n)),keyby=.(level,geo,epiWeek,age)]
tosave2[,sex:="All"]
tosave3 <- tosave1[,.(n=sum(n)),keyby=.(level,geo,epiWeek,sex)]
tosave3[,age:="All"]
tosave4 <- tosave1[,.(n=sum(n)),keyby=.(level,geo,epiWeek)]
tosave4[,sex:="All"]
tosave4[,age:="All"]
tosave <- rbind(tosave4,tosave3,tosave2,tosave1)
tosave[,pop:=10000]
```

Epicurves is the epidemiological term for a time series graph showing the number of reported cases on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.

Right now (codeathon 2019-01-19), we are hard coding each epicurve into its own page. However, in the future, we will make one "Epicurve" page that has a number of options that allows all possible/desirable epicurves to be generated on the same page (see: https://github.com/IFRCGo/cbs/issues/922).

We now demonstrate the important definitions:

**facet_grid**

Here we have a facet_grid with `x=age` and `y=sex`. We tend to use facet_grid when we have a small amount of values to facet on, and we know how many there will be (e.g. age and sex, maybe health factor).

As far as we know, this is not possible using Highcharts. We might need to use some React trickery to duplicate multiple Highchart graphs to recreate this effect.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
q <- ggplot(tosave,aes(x=epiWeek,y=n))
q <- q + geom_col(alpha=0.7)
q <- q + labs(title=sprintf("Weekly epicurve from %s to %s",minDate,maxDate))
q <- q + labs(caption=sprintf("Created %s",lubridate::today()))
q <- q + scale_x_discrete("Epiweek")
q <- q + scale_y_continuous("Number of reported cases")
q <- q + facet_grid(sex~age)
q <- q + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust=0.5))
q
```

**facet_wrap**

Here we have a facet_wrap on `sex`. We use facet_wrap when there will be a lot of values to facet on, and we don't know how many there will be in advance (e.g. geography is a good one).

As far as we know, this is not possible using Highcharts. We might need to use some React trickery to duplicate multiple Highchart graphs to recreate this effect.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
q <- ggplot(tosave,aes(x=epiWeek,y=n))
q <- q + geom_col(alpha=0.7)
q <- q + labs(title=sprintf("Weekly epicurve from %s to %s",minDate,maxDate))
q <- q + labs(caption=sprintf("Created %s",lubridate::today()))
q <- q + scale_x_discrete("Epiweek")
q <- q + scale_y_continuous("Number of reported cases")
q <- q + facet_wrap(~sex,ncol=2)
q <- q + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust=0.5))
q
```

**dodge**

Here we dodge on `sex`. This means we put the values side-by-side in the same graph (and colour them differently). We dodge when there are a small amount of values to compare against.

This is definitely possible using Highcharts.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
q <- ggplot(tosave,aes(x=epiWeek,y=n,fill=sex))
q <- q + geom_col(alpha=1,position="dodge")
q <- q + labs(title=sprintf("Weekly epicurve from %s to %s",minDate,maxDate))
q <- q + labs(caption=sprintf("Created %s",lubridate::today()))
q <- q + scale_x_discrete("Epiweek")
q <- q + scale_y_continuous("Number of reported cases")
q <- q + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust=0.5))
q
```


**Dynamic options**

Geography:

Levels (this part will need to be more flexible depending on the circumstances, but this is a good start):

- all (i.e. all the data -- national level)
- district
- region
- village

The 'geographical value' is stored in 'geo'. i.e. if `level=district`, then maybe `geo=Western Norway`. If `level=village` then maybe `geo=Oslo`.

`Sex` is:

- All
- Male
- Female

`Age` is:

- All
- Age <5
- Age 5+

## Weekly epicurves facet_grid by age/sex

Note: The current chart in Web Template has created the graph **dodged** by age/sex, but we need it to be **facet_grid** by age/sex. As mentioned above, this might not be possible in Highcharts and might need some React trickery to get it working.

Here we display four weekly epicurves, one for each age/sex combination.

Important to note:

- We display `year-isoweek` on the x-axis
- Weeks with zero cases must be displayed
- Y-axis remains the same height for all panels, to allow for easy comparison

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Here we display multiple weekly epicurves, one for each geographical area.

Important to note:

- We should probably be able to choose the granularity of geographical area (region/district/village)
- We display `year-isoweek` on the x-axis
- Weeks with zero cases must be displayed
- Y-axis remains the same height for all panels, to allow for easy comparison (this should probably be a toggle?)
- Very important: We should also implement one version where the outcome is: `(number of reported cases)/(estimation population)*10000` (i.e. number of reported cases per 10.000 population).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toplot <- d[,.(n=sum(value)),by=.(epiWeek,district)]

Here we display a map with categorized number of cases.

Important to note:

- We should probably be able to choose the granularity of geographical area (region/district/village)
- We should be able to change the time-frame
- Not reporting regions should be highlighted
- The graphing/outcome should be categorical NOT a continuous gradient. Probably no more than 4 categories.
- Very important: We should also implement one version where the outcome is: `(number of reported cases)/(estimation population)*10000` (i.e. number of reported cases per 10.000 population).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toplot <- d[epiWeek==max(epiWeek),.(n=sum(value)),by=.(epiWeek,district)]
m <- merge(map,toplot,by.x="id",by.y="district",all.x=T)
b <- unique(quantile(m$n,na.rm=T))
m[,fillVal:=cut(n,breaks = b)]
l <- levels(m$fillVal)
m[,fillVal:=as.character(fillVal)]
m[is.na(fillVal),fillVal:="Not reporting"]
m[,fillVal:=factor(fillVal,levels=c("Not reporting",l))]

q <- ggplot()

This is very similar to the above map, but allows for a more nuanced view of the numbers.

Important to note:

- We should probably be able to choose the granularity of geographical area (region/district/village)
- We should be able to change the time-frame
- The graphing/outcome should be CONTINUOUS
- Very important: We should also implement one version where the outcome is: `(number of reported cases)/(estimation population)*10000` (i.e. number of reported cases per 10.000 population).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
toplot <- d[epiWeek==max(epiWeek),.(n=sum(value)),by=.(epiWeek,district)]

q <- ggplot(toplot,aes(x=district,y=n))
q <- q + geom_col(alpha=0.7)
q <- q + labs(title=sprintf("Epicurve from %s to %s",minDate,maxDate))
q <- q + labs(caption=sprintf("Created %s",lubridate::today()))
q <- q + scale_x_discrete("")
q <- q + scale_y_continuous("Number of reported alerts")
q <- q + coord_flip()
q <- q + labs(title="Cases in epiweek X")
#q <- q + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust=0.5))

# VOLUNTEER INFORMATION

The previous graphs have been about health risks. We also need information about the volunteers.

## Aggregate information (basic)

We require a table with each row corresponding to a particular geographical region (granularity of geographical level will need to be specified), and two columns:

- How many volunteers are active
- How many volunteers are registered

So for example, if granularity is "national" then we would expect only 1 row. If granularity is "district" then we would have 1 row per district.

## Individual level information (complicated)

We require a table with each row corresponding to an individual volunteer and multiple columns:

- Name
- Location
- How long they have been engaged
- Number of days since last report
- Has reported in the last 0-7 days? [colored box, blue if yes, red if no]
- Has reported in the last 8-14 days? [colored box, blue if yes, red if no]
- Has reported in the last 15-21 days? [colored box, blue if yes, red if no]
- Has reported in the last 22-28 days? [colored box, blue if yes, red if no]
- Has reported in the last 29-35 days? [colored box, blue if yes, red if no]
- Has reported in the last 36-42 days? [colored box, blue if yes, red if no]

Note: The 0-7, 8-14, etc numbers are for a weekly example. There will need to be the option to specify "daily", "weekly", or "monthly".

This table will be linked to a map where the GPS coordinates of each of the volunteers is displayed. It will be possible to select individuals using the map, and these selected individuals will then be highlighted in the above table.

## Program statistics

Is it possible to display this information as summary program statistics?

- Number of volunteers
- % of Red Cross volunteers active the last 30(XX) days
- Number of trained volunteers / total sum of volunteers
- Number of active volunteers the last 30 days
- Number of Red Cross volunteers trained by moths
- Above information displayed by Age/ sex


## District/Person reporting funnel plot A

NOTE: THIS SECTION HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED IN PRIORITY. FOR THE MOMENT, DO NOT IMPLEMENT.

The idea of this funnel plot is to identify districts/people who are reporting worse than expected.

For each month, we count the number of messages sent, and the number of correctly sent messages. From this, we generate an "expected proportion of received messages that are correct" (e.g. 80%). Then, for i = 1, ..., 100 (or higher, as necessary) we calculate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles according to the binomial distribution. That is, (e.g. for i=40) what is the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of a Binom(n=40, p=0.8) distribution. These percentiles are our boundaries as displayed in the graph.

Important to note:

- We should be able to switch between district/people/other grouping measure
- We should be able to change the time-frame
- Maybe only the people/groups who are "lower than expected" should be highlighted in some way?
