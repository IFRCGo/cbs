# Development Environment

## Source Control: Git

We use Git for version control. If you need the basic CLI client - download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
If you an unfamiliar with Git, this e-book is a great way to get started: [Pro Git book, written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).  

## Frontend: Node.js & Angular.js

- Node.js (download at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)). This may include an older version of NPM. Update NPM using `npm install npm@latest -g`
- Typescript (`npm install -g typescript`)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`)

## Backend: .NET Core

The backend code is written using C# and .NET.  
Download and install the [.NET Core 2.0 SDK and runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).

## Storage: MongoDB

MongoDB is used for storage, and we recommend installing [MongoChef / Studio3T](https://studio3t.com) which has cross platform support.  
For using this with Azure and CosmosDB, there is a write-up [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-mongochef)

## Docker

We use Docker to build and distribute the applications.
Download the Docker Community Edition [here](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community).

## Code editor / IDE

Choose the editor or IDE you prefer.

### Editor: Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio code is a free, open source, cross platform editor:
Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### IDE: Visual Studio 2017 or for Mac

The Community edition of Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2017 for Mac can be used for free in open source development: 
Download it [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

## Terminal

You will need any terminal and git. To get quickly up and running, suggested options are [cmder](http://cmder.net/) on Windows and [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) on Mac.
