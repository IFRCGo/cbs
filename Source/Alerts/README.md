NB. Proxy generation is disbled at the moment:
Until doLittle has fixed an issue be aware that all references in frontend to their queries and commands needs to be fixed manually. This affects the files in Web/Features

When they generate proxies, in the top of their files they import @dolittle/commands and @dolittle/queries depending on the domain model. To fix it change them to @dolittle/commands/dist/commonjs and @dolittle/queries/dist/commonjs. Afterwards you will probably have to restart your frontend with "npm start". (edited) 

---------

To get frontend to build, the following needs to be done (until build is simplified):
NB. This needs to be done in a terminal that supports "cp" (Git Bash does so for Windows)
- Go to Source/Navigation/Web.Commons do "npm install"
- Go to Source/Navigation/Web.Nodejs do "npm install"
- Go to Source/..bounded context../Web do "npm install"
- If you get an error saying that it can find a file or directory in a foldername with the word .staging in it delete the whole package.json-lock file in Source/..bounded context../Web and rerun "npm install" in the same place
- run "npm start"
