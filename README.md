# Red Cross: Community Based Surveillance (CBS)

Join the world’s largest humanitarian organisation and code for the greater good!

**The challenge:**
Public health crises, such as disease outbreaks and famine, most often occur where health systems and public health surveillance is weak. Emergencies, whether sudden or slow onset, increase people’s vulnerabilities to health risks and infectious disease can quickly spread and cause life threatening outbreaks.

**The solution:**
Community Based Surveillance (CBS) allows communities, volunteers and the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement to identify and alert of potential outbreaks themselves. This means that we can respond to emerging public health crises much quicker and therefore prevent excess death and illness.

## Contributing

The CBS platform is built by technology contributors and the open source community. With input from the Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers who are implementing the platform on the ground, the technology contributors help us create a platform which is fit for purpose.

We are constantly looking for engaged contributors to help us with the development of our community based surveillance platform.

There are several ways to start contributing:
* Read the guide on [How to contribute](https://github.com/IFRCGo/cbs/wiki/How-to-contribute).
* Sign up for one of our coding [events](https://cbsrc.org/contribute/events/).
* Join the discussion on [Slack](https://cbsv2.slack.com/)

Please also see our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
