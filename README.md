# Nyss

Welcome to the Red Cross Codeathon in Brussels!
We are going to work  repository for the new CBS solution, called *NYSS*! 

Nyss is a norwegian word and means to "get the wind of something". And the first norwegian computer was called [Nusse](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusse).

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository, and open it in the editor of your choice. We have tested it to work with _Visual Studio 2019_ and _Visual Studio Code_.
2. Start the application:
   * For _Visual Studio 2019_ users: run the `Nyss.Web` Project - or hit `F5`.
   * For _Visual Studio Code_ users: run the `Start Debugging` command - or hit `F5`.
3. This will start the application and open a browser tab to show you the UI when it's ready. __Note:__ the first time takes a while to start as it is building and installing dependencies for both the back-end and front-end code.
4. Start coding to save some lives!
