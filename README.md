# Red Cross: Community Based Surveillance (CBS)

Join the world’s largest humanitarian organisation and code for good!

**The challenge:**
Public health crises, such as disease outbreaks and famine most often occur where health systems and public health surveillance is weak. Emergencies, whether sudden or slow onset, increase people’s vulnerabilities to health risks – and infectious disease can quickly spread and cause life threatening outbreaks.

**The solution:**
Community Based Surveillance (CBS) allows communities, volunteers and the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement to identify, alert and respond to emerging public health crisis before they spin out of control and cause excess death and illness.

## Our next milestone

We are currently working on the MVP (minimum viable product) of CBS. At the moment there is a plague outbreak in Madagascar, with 57 deaths and more than 680 cases reported, and it keeps spreading. The sooner we can test CBS in the field, the more lives will be saved. 

The MVP will enable: 
- Data collectors in the field to report health events by SMS
- Data managers to view the incoming reports

Ideally, we wish to extend the MVP to also include the creation of "projects" and a way of defining and editing health events, but this will depend on how active our contributors are. Our main priority is getting the MVP tested in the field so that the Red Cross can identify and respond to outbreaks in an even more efficient manner. 

## Contributing

We would love your help in taking CBS to the next level. 
Read more about how you can [contribute](./Documentation/Contribution/contributing.md) and the different [projects](./Documentation/Projects/index.md) you can contribute to. 

Our biggest shortage at the moment is designers and frond-end developers, but that does not mean we don't need your if you are a backend developer, project manager, tester, etc. Reach out to us if you're unsure about how your expertise can be of use to this project!
