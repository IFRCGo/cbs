# Red Cross: Nyss

Join the world’s largest humanitarian organisation and code for the greater good!

**The challenge:**
Public health crises, such as disease outbreaks and famine, most often occur where health systems and public health surveillance is weak. Emergencies, whether sudden or slow onset, increase people’s vulnerabilities to health risks and infectious disease can quickly spread and cause life threatening outbreaks.

**The solution:**
Nyss (Community Based Surveillance ) allows communities, volunteers and the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement to identify and alert of potential outbreaks themselves. This means that we can respond to emerging public health crises much quicker and therefore prevent excess death and illness.

Nyss is a norwegian word and means to "get the wind of something". And the first norwegian computer was called [Nusse](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusse).

## Contributing

The Nyss platform is built by technology contributors and the open source community. With input from the Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers who are implementing the platform on the ground, the technology contributors help us create a platform which is fit for purpose.

We are constantly looking for engaged contributors to help us with the development of our community based surveillance platform.

There are several ways to start contributing:
* Sign up for one of our coding [events](https://cbsrc.org/contribute/events/).
* Join the discussion on [Slack](https://cbsv2.slack.com/)

## You need to have installed
* Visual Studio Code (with C# extension) or Visual Studio 2019
* NodeJS (works at least with v10)
* .Net Core SDK 2.2 

## Getting started coding
1. Clone this repository: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cbs-brussels-2019/Nyss.git`, and open it in the editor of your choice. We have tested it to work with _Visual Studio 2019_ and _Visual Studio Code_. Nyss has quite a lot of history, so it would take a while to download all of it to your computer - so setting depth to a low number (making a shallow clone) speeds it up.
2. Start the application:
   * For _Visual Studio 2019_ users: run the `Nyss.Web` Project - or hit `F5`.
   * For _Visual Studio Code_ users: run the `Start Debugging` command - or hit `F5`.
3. This will start the application and open a browser tab to show you the UI when it's ready. __Note:__ the first time takes a while to start as it is building and installing dependencies for both the back-end and front-end code.
4. Start coding to save some lives!
